## ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This project is currently under active development and at it's infancy. Features, API endpoints, and functionality may change frequently.  
Expect changes in the comming days. The project structure will change to be more organized. With separate files for tools tools.py and graph defiinintion graph.py. And the Langraph graph will be expanded to have better flow beteen states. This should give users a better to have a more natural interaction with the chat.

## Future Features
1. Extend to work in other regions.
2. Improve and expand the graph.
3. Access to clinical tryal data.
4. Feature that let's you describe the ideal specialist and will go throught reviews and match your prefference to a specialist.

## Agent MD LangGraph Architecture

Below is a diagram of the current LangGraph workflow for AgentMD, generated from the code:

![AgentMD LangGraph](images/Agent_MD_graph.png)

### Explanation
- **start**: The entry point of the graph.
- **chatbot**: Processes user input, decides if a tool is needed (via `maybe_route_to_tools`), and generates responses.
- **tools**: Executes `fetch_doctors_tool` or `retrieve_reviews_tool` when called.
- **human**: Accepts user input (terminal in `main.py`, HTTP in `mainFastAPI.py`).
- **end**: Terminates the graph when no further action is needed.
- **Edges**: 
  - `start â†’ chatbot`: Initial entry.
  - `chatbot â†’ tools` if a tool call is detected.
  - `chatbot â†’ human` for user input.
  - `chatbot â†’ end` if no tool call.
  - `tools â†’ chatbot` after execution.
- **Note**: The FastAPI version handles "human" input via web requests.

This structure supports queries like "Find the top 3 urologists in London" and follow-up questions.
