Below is a diagram of the current LangGraph workflow for AgentMD, generated from the code:

![AgentMD LangGraph](agentmd_graph.png)

### Explanation
- **start**: The entry point of the graph.
- **chatbot**: Processes user input, decides if a tool is needed (via `maybe_route_to_tools`), and generates responses.
- **tools**: Executes `fetch_doctors_tool` or `retrieve_reviews_tool` when called.
- **human**: Accepts user input (terminal in `main.py`, HTTP in `mainFastAPI.py`).
- **end**: Terminates the graph when no further action is needed.
- **Edges**: 
  - `start â†’ chatbot`: Initial entry.
  - `chatbot â†’ tools` if a tool call is detected.
  - `chatbot â†’ human` for user input.
  - `chatbot â†’ end` if no tool call.
  - `tools â†’ chatbot` after execution.
- **Note**: The FastAPI version handles "human" input via web requests.

This structure supports queries like "Find the top 3 urologists in London" and follow-up questions.
